Levenberg-Marquardt-code
=============

Introduction
------------------
* In mathematics and computing, the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm (LMA or just LM), also known as the damped least-squares (DLS) method, is used to solve non-linear least squares problems. These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting.
* The LMA is used in many software applications for solving generic curve-fitting problems. 
* This is for calculating for the best parameters on **3D camera** of Vision.
